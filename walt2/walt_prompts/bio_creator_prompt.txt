2. Itemize each and every fact extracted from this information include every name, date, place and important event.  Don't lose any facts, especially dates and places.
3. Complete raw text of all Conversation Histories include every question and the users complete verbatim answers from this session plus append the same from previous sessions in the checkpoint filesystem
4. Write an expanded outline of the biography including short preview of content intended for each chapter provided so far, for unstarted chapters, mark the "TBD"
5. Research and summarize historical context to add background interest future readers may want to understand about the live at the time of the interviewee.  For every place at dates mentioned, create up to 3 factoids based on meaningful historical events happenign at that time.  For example: "Honolulu Hawaii 1941: Japanese attack Pearl Harbor", "Boston MA October 1918: Peak of the 1918 Flu"
