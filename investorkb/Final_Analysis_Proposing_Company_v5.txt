Final Analysis and Scoring Report for Proposing Company VR with Adjusted Template
This report evaluates Proposing Company VR, a company that provides immersive 360-degree VR views from a player’s viewpoint. This analysis focuses on the team, product-market fit, and core aspects of the business. Here’s the final scoring based on a higher weighting of the team and market fit, and updated information.

1. Size of Market (Heavily Weighted for Product-Market Fit): 8
Analysis: Proposing Company targets the sports coaching, broadcasting, and entertainment sectors. The market for immersive experiences in sports is expanding, particularly in VR-based training and fan engagement. Growth in sectors such as sports tech and fan experiences points to a large addressable market, especially as VR technologies are becoming more accessible to teams and fans alike. Although they focus primarily on hockey, expansion into other sports is feasible, which could increase the total addressable market.
Upside: The combination of training tools and fan experiences offers significant upside potential in an expanding market.
Red Flag: Focus on a single sport (hockey) limits scalability unless the company diversifies quickly into other sports or entertainment sectors.

2. Technology, Patents, and Moat: 6.5
Analysis: Proposing Company’s patent-pending flexxCAM360 VR technology stands out for its ability to provide first-person and 360-degree views for both training and broadcast purposes. However, there are competitors, such as iTrackHockey and IcePerk, offering adjacent solutions, though they lack the VR angle. While Proposing Company has applied for patents, none have been granted yet, meaning the moat is largely dependent on the approval and enforcement of these patents.
Red Flag: Patent protection is still pending, and the market includes other players providing similar solutions, potentially eroding Proposing Company’s competitive edge.
Upside: If the patent is granted and Proposing Company continues to innovate in integrating VR into broadcasting and training, it could maintain a competitive edge.

3. Deal and Deal Structure: 6.5
Analysis: Proposing Company is offering a $1.75M convertible note with a pre-money valuation of $2M, which is reasonable for a seed-stage company with novel technology. The valuation appears appropriate given their early stage and the potential of their technology. The company aims for a 5x to 10x exit based on their forecast, contingent on expanding their technology into additional sports and markets.
Red Flag: The company has yet to secure major clients or revenue, so returns will depend on future fundraising and hitting key milestones.
Upside: If Proposing Company can secure partnerships with major sports leagues or broadcasting companies, the deal could become more attractive to early investors.

4. Team (Heavily Weighted): 9
Analysis: The leadership team, led by Keith Blase, includes experienced individuals from the sports and broadcasting industries. The addition of Mike Sullivan, an NHL coach, further strengthens the team’s expertise in professional sports. The team has worked together on multiple ventures and brings deep knowledge of both the sports training and media landscapes. This experience and network are crucial for market penetration.
Red Flag: No significant red flags regarding the team’s qualifications, though scaling a tech-heavy business model in the competitive VR market remains challenging.
Upside: The leadership's extensive experience in sports management and broadcasting provides the company with significant industry leverage, especially in securing partnerships.

5. Marketing and Sales Plans: 5.5
Analysis: Proposing Company has yet to fully develop a comprehensive marketing and sales strategy, although they plan to target professional sports teams and collegiate leagues. Early-stage marketing remains speculative, and the company has not yet demonstrated significant traction in signing contracts or partnerships. The leadership’s connections in the sports industry offer potential pathways for future deals.
Red Flag: The lack of concrete marketing plans and signed partnerships at this stage may slow down revenue generation.
Upside: Strong industry relationships and high-profile advisors may help fast-track partnerships with key players in sports broadcasting and training.

6. Financials: 4.5
Analysis: Proposing Company is currently pre-revenue, and the pitch deck does not include immediate revenue generation. The company has a significant runway ahead and will need further funding to support operations. While their financial projections are optimistic, they depend heavily on securing contracts with major sports organizations.
Red Flag: No current revenue and the need for further funding rounds create financial risk for early investors.
Upside: If the company secures early partnerships and enters new markets, it can mitigate this risk by establishing a more solid revenue stream.

7. Exit Potential: 7
Analysis: Proposing Company’s exit potential includes licensing deals or being acquired by larger broadcasting or sports tech companies. The growth in the immersive sports experience market makes them an attractive acquisition target if they can show significant traction. The company also has potential for an IPO if they expand into additional sports or entertainment markets.
Red Flag: Exit potential depends heavily on market traction and successful product adoption, which could take longer than anticipated.
Upside: A strong partnership with a broadcasting giant or professional league could accelerate the exit timeline.

Total Weighted Score: 7.2/10

High-Risk Areas (RED FLAGS):
Pre-revenue status: The company remains pre-revenue, with no signed contracts, making financial projections highly speculative.
Patent uncertainty: With the patent still pending, competitors could potentially develop similar solutions, reducing Proposing Company’s market advantage.
Niche market focus: Focusing only on hockey may limit growth unless the company expands quickly into other sports or sectors.

Upside Potential:
Innovative technology: The ability to provide immersive VR experiences in sports training and broadcasting is an exciting prospect, particularly as fan engagement technologies continue to grow.
Strong leadership: The team’s extensive experience in sports management and broadcasting provides significant potential for securing strategic partnerships and scaling quickly.
Expanding market: The global market for immersive sports experiences, including VR training and broadcast engagement, is expanding rapidly, providing ample opportunities for Proposing Company to grow.

Conclusion:
Proposing Company VR has significant potential in the sports tech and fan engagement markets, but faces challenges around securing initial clients and proving its product’s traction in the market. While the team is a strong asset, the company’s current pre-revenue status and patent uncertainty present notable risks. With a total score of 7.2/10, Proposing Company shows promise but needs to overcome several hurdles before it becomes an attractive investment for larger-scale angel investors.
