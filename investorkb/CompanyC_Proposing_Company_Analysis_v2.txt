Here’s a comprehensive analysis of Proposing Company based on the provided pitch deck, general market research on concussion detection and analysis, and the competitive landscape.
Executive Summary
Proposing Company has developed a patented, rapid, and non-invasive saliva-based test to detect concussions, aiming to make concussion diagnosis accessible in sports, military, and emergency scenarios. Their technology is positioned as the first saliva-based concussion test, providing near-instant results and reducing reliance on existing, slower blood-based diagnostic methods. Proposing Company leverages a mobile app for patient tracking, which further strengthens their offering by enabling long-term concussion management.
Overall Recommendation: Move to screen for further due diligence, given the strong market demand, uniqueness, and unmet need in concussion diagnostics.

1. Leadership of the Company
Proposing Company’s leadership team should ideally have a blend of expertise in both medical technology and sports health to navigate clinical trials, regulatory requirements, and commercialization in healthcare.
Score: 7.5/10
Weighted Score: 15/20
Notes: For further due diligence, review the depth of the team’s expertise in scaling health technology and their connections within the sports and military sectors.

2. Market Assessment and Product-Market Fit
Market Size: The global concussion diagnostics market, especially in sports and military contexts, is expanding with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% until 2030. In the U.S. alone, over 4 million concussions are reported annually from sports injuries​.
Product-Market Fit: Proposing Company addresses the limitations of existing diagnostics, which often involve delayed, indirect, or invasive blood tests and costly neuroimaging. Their saliva-based test is uniquely positioned for environments where time-sensitive and accessible testing is critical, such as sports fields and battlefields.
Score: 8/10
Weighted Score: 16/20
Notes: Further analysis of pricing strategy and partnerships, especially with athletic organizations and military entities, is needed to validate market penetration.

3. Competition
Direct Competitors: Existing concussion diagnostics rely on blood-based tests (e.g., Banyan Biomarkers) or neuroimaging technologies (e.g., CT/MRI). These are slower and often impractical in-field, providing Proposing Company a potential competitive edge as the only saliva-based test.
Indirect Competitors: Applications or services that perform symptom-based assessments or digital cognitive tests may be considered indirect competitors, as they offer alternatives to initial diagnostics.
Score: 7/10
Weighted Score: 10.5/15
Notes: Conan’s technology’s value proposition will be strengthened if patents hold against possible competitors developing similar biomarker-based saliva tests. Monitoring competitive developments in related diagnostics is recommended​​.

4. Technology, Patents, and Moat
Technology: Proposing Company’s platform includes a rapid, field-deployable diagnostic device paired with a mobile app for longitudinal tracking, designed to work outside traditional healthcare settings.
Patents: The pitch deck claims patent protection, which establishes a barrier to entry but requires validation against NIH and patent databases to confirm exclusivity in biomarker selection and saliva-based processing​​.
Score: 8/10
Weighted Score: 12/15
Notes: Confirm the breadth and enforceability of patents to assess protection strength fully. Additional patents in software for tracking could strengthen their moat.

5. Deal Terms and Valuation
To accurately assess deal terms, more clarity on Proposing Company’s pre-money valuation, cap, and terms (e.g., SAFE note, equity) is required.
Score: 6/10
Weighted Score: 6/10
Notes: Early-stage valuation relative to future revenue projections would require a realistic assessment, factoring in fundraising needs to reach breakeven and achieve a 10x exit potential.

6. Financial Projections
Revenue Growth Potential: Revenue is likely to stem initially from direct sales in high-need markets, with subsequent partnerships for larger-scale rollouts. Given the healthcare segment, particularly in sports and military, a cautious growth model with steady market adoption over 5-10 years is likely.
Score: 7/10
Weighted Score: 7/10
Notes: Long-term revenue projections will depend on the ability to secure partnerships and reach volume contracts, particularly with sports and healthcare providers​​.

7. Go-to-Market Strategy
Strategy: Proposing Company has a clear B2B strategy for sports leagues, military applications, and medical centers. Their mobile application also provides an added avenue for patient engagement and monitoring.
Score: 8/10
Weighted Score: 8/10
Notes: Focus on partnerships with influential sports and military institutions could accelerate market adoption. Monitoring the commercialization strategy and pilot programs would be beneficial.

8. Exit Potential
The exit potential for Proposing Company lies in acquisition by a major diagnostic, healthcare, or sports tech company, particularly as concussion awareness and diagnostics are increasingly prioritized.
Score: 7/10
Weighted Score: 3.5/5
Notes: Early conversations with potential acquirers or partnerships could validate this pathway. Establishing a clear acquisition target list would enhance the exit plan's strength.

9. Risk Assessment
Key Risks:
Regulatory Approval: Securing FDA clearance or equivalent is crucial. Early-stage healthcare devices face potential regulatory delays.
Competitive Response: Larger diagnostics players may attempt to enter the saliva-based market, and potential regulatory or IP challenges could arise.
Execution on Partnerships: Conan’s heavy reliance on securing partnerships poses a risk if these are delayed or fail to materialize.
Score: 6.5/10
Weighted Score: 6.5/10
Notes: Identifying potential backup markets or partners could mitigate these risks.

Scoring Summary and Conclusion
Total Weighted Score: 84.5/110
Unweighted Average: 7.25/10
Weighted average ;   7.7

Recommendation
Move to Prescreen: Proposing Company shows promise in an expanding market with minimal direct competition in saliva-based diagnostics. While regulatory, partnership, and competitive risks are present, these are balanced by high growth potential, strong product-market fit, and a unique diagnostic platform.
