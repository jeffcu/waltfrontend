Prompt:

I want you to generate a detailed, step-by-step guide for setting up a Mac environment to develop and deploy a Flask application using AI-generated code, with zero manual coding.

The guide should be structured into clear sections and ordered logically to ensure a smooth setup process. Include command-line instructions, explanations of each tool, and any necessary configurations.

Step-by-Step Setup Instructions Should Cover:

1. Installing Essential Tools

	•	Install Homebrew (if not installed)
	•	Install Git using Homebrew
	•	Install Heroku CLI using Homebrew
	•	Install a code editor (recommend Atom or VS Code)

2. Setting Up the Project Folder and Git

	•	Open Terminal and create a new project directory
	•	Navigate into the project directory
	•	Initialize a Git repository inside the folder

3. Setting Up Heroku

	•	Log in to Heroku
	•	Create a new Heroku app
	•	Set up Git tracking for Heroku deployment

4. Creating the Required Flask File Structure

	•	Create folders and files:
	•	my-ai-app/
	•	static/ (for CSS, JS, images)
	•	templates/ (for HTML files)
	•	app.py (Flask app entry point)
	•	requirements.txt (dependencies)
	•	Procfile (Heroku startup instructions)
	•	.gitignore (exclude unnecessary files)

5. Installing and Configuring Python & Flask

	•	Install Python (if not installed)
	•	Create and activate a virtual environment
	•	Install Flask, OpenAI, and Gunicorn

6. Setting Up Heroku-Specific Configurations

	•	Explain the role of Procfile and runtime.txt
	•	Add required dependencies to requirements.txt
	•	Set Heroku environment variables for API keys securely

7. Preparing for AI Code Generation

	•	Explain how combiner.py helps maintain AI accuracy
	•	Show how to bundle project files and feed them to AI

Output Format:

	•	Use numbered steps with command-line examples
	•	Explain each command in simple terms
	•	Provide copy-paste-ready commands where applicable

Make sure the instructions flow logically, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one so that a beginner can follow without confusion.
